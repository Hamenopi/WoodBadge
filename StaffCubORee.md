Staff Cub O Ree

## SMART ##

### SPECIFIC ###

Staff Cub O Ree 2021 at Camp Karankawa on Saturday, April 24, 2021, to help ensure success.

### MEASURABLE ###

I will leave the house by 6 to get to Camp K by 7:30 and help set up as needed.  
I will then assist the Rangemasters on the range to ensure a smooth flowing, safe, and fun environment for the cubs.  
Once the range is closed, I will assist in any duties in breaking down events.

### ATTAINABLE ###

Sign up for Cub O Ree.  
Communicate with the director about expectations.  
Set an alarm to wake me and the kids up.  
Leave at a time ensuring I will be arriving early.

### RELEVANT ###

Cubs love to camp and at camp, they love the range.  
Staffing as a Rangemaster enables Cub o Ree to maximize a safe and fun environment for the cubs.

### TIMELY ###

Cub O Ree is hurting for staff and the staff they do have are not certified to work on the range.  
Range training is hours long and the timeline is short.  
Staffing range frees up time for other staff to be better prepared in the other areas of cub o ree.
